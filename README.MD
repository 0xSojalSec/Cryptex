## Overview:
Cryptex is an advanced cryptography hacking tool created by a joint development between The SAINTS and Cosmodium CyberSecurity. It was originally two separte tools, one reffered to as "Cryptex" and the other as "[The Codex Project](https://github.com/CosmodiumCS/the-codex-project)". But on May 2, 2022, the lead developers Cythes and Blue Cosmo joined forces to build a central cryptography tool. Since then, plenty of others have joinded the project to build it into what we one day hope to be, the "Metasploit of Cryptography".

Cryptex is capable of advanced encryption, decryption, and breaking ciphers through various mehtods. These methods include but are not limited to bruteforcing, cryptographic wordlising, letter frequencies, plaintext formatting, and cracking.

## About Us
**[Cythes](https://twitter.com/CythesOut): Project Manager**
I started learning computers around middle school age with my discovery & passion of PC Gaming.  A few years later I'd stumbled into Ubuntu 8.04 soon started learning programming, hacking on and off, while over the next decade working on projects ranging from Android personal safety applications to light game development.

My current obsession being the development of a cryptography toolkit aptly named CrypteX as part of CICADA while attempting to avoid SVT from all the caffeine I main line in a given day.

**[BlueCosmo](https://twitter.com/CosmodiumCS): Lead Developer**
Started Cosmodium at 17 and since then has made significant changes in the cybersecurity community.  A reasonably known content creator and python programming whiz to say the least.

**[Mart]: Developer**
I started tinkering with computers I think around primary school, then in junior high school I started doing more tech stuff, then in high school I started learning more proper programming, and I began to do a lot of programming in my spare time, and at school, but I was always at least 10 steps ahead of what my class was learning, and eventually I ended up finding this place.
