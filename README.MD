## So why?  
Honestly, I'm not sure why I am doing this.  
The project started with a post on facebook in which was encrypted text in Base64. I thought to myself..  
>"I wonder if I can make a program to decrypt this on my own."    

I started with HEX then moved into Base64. In the most recent update I added a password generator.  
The current plan is to expand into harder encryption / decryption and make it an actual decent program.

#### What can it do:
- Encode / Decode Hex
- Encode / Decode Base64
- Generate Passwords
- Break Randomly :D
