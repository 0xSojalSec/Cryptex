## About Us
**Alex | Cythes: Lead Developer**
I started learning computers around middle school age with my discovery & passion of PC Gaming.  A few years later I'd stumbled into Ubuntu 8.04 soon started learning programming, hacking on and off, while over the next decade working on projects ranging from Android personal safety applications to light game development.

My current obsession being the development of a cryptography toolkit aptly named CrypteX as part of CICADA while attempting to avoid SVT from all the caffeine I main line in a given day.
